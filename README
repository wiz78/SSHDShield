SSHDShield                https://github.com/wiz78/SSHDShield


What is it?
===========

SSHDShield is a daemon that monitors your sshd log looking for signs of a brute force
attack. Upon detecting it, it will call a configurable command to ban the host. Bans
will be removed after a configurable time span.

Installation
============

"./configure; make install" should compile and install the sshdshield executable
in your sbin directory. 


Usage
=====

You need to pass the name of the config file to use on the command line. 
An example configuration file is shown below:


                              ---8<---8<---
[General]
; log to monitor
LogPath			= /var/log/messages
; consider only the lines with this ident string
SSHIdent		= sshd

[PasswordFailures]
; defaults: 3 failures per minute
MaxAllowed		= 3
Interval		= 60

[Ban]
; ban time, in seconds
BanTime			= 7200
; command to ban the host %h
BanCmd			= /sbin/iptables -A banned -s %h -j DROP
; command to remove the ban
UnbanCmd		= /sbin/iptables -D banned -s %h -j DROP

[Strings]
; block hosts as soon as they try to authenticate as a non-existant user. This line
; contains a string to look for in the log to apply this rule
InvalidUser  	= invalid user
; string used by your sshd daemon when a user enters a wrong password
WrongPassword	= failed password
; the word just before the host address in the logs
HostPrefix		= from 
                              ---8<---8<---

You need to restart sshdshield after changing the configuration.
